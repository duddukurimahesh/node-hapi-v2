## Features

- Fast
- Maintains a connection to the server to maximise notification batching and throughput.
- Enhanced binary interface support, with error handling
- Automatically sends unsent notifications if an error occurs
- Feedback service support
- Complies with all best practises laid out by Apple

## Installation

Via [npm][]:

	$ npm install apn
	
As a submodule of your project (you will also need to install [q][q])

	$ git submodule add http://github.com/argon/node-apn.git apn
	$ git submodule update --init

## Quick Start

This is intended as a brief introduction, please refer to the documentation in `doc/` for more details.

### Load in the module

	var apn = require('apn');

### Connecting
Create a new connection to the APN gateway server, passing a dictionary of options to the constructor. If you name your certificate and key files appropriately (`cert.pem` and `key.pem`) then the defaults should be suitable to get you up and running.

```javascript
	var options = { };

	var apnConnection = new apn.Connection(options);
```

By default, if the environment variable `NODE_ENV=production` is set, the module will connect to the production gateway. Otherwise it will connect to the sandbox. This along with many other settings can be overriden with the options object.

For more information about configuration options consult the [documentation](doc/connection.markdown).

Help with preparing the key and certificate files for connection can be found in the [wiki][certificateWiki]

### Sending a notification
To send a notification first create a `Device` object. Pass it the device token as either a hexadecimal string, or alternatively as a `Buffer` object containing the token in binary form.

	var myDevice = new apn.Device(token);

Next, create a notification object, set the relevant parameters (See the [payload documentation][pl] for more details.) and use the `pushNotification` method on the connection to send it.

	var note = new apn.Notification();
	
	note.expiry = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 3600; // Expires 1 hour from now.
	note.badge = 3;
	note.sound = "ping.aiff";
	note.alert = "\uD83D\uDCE7 \u2709 You have a new message";
	note.payload = {'messageFrom': 'Caroline'};
	
	apnConnection.pushNotification(note, myDevice);

The above options will compile the following dictionary to send to the device:

	{"messageFrom":"Caroline","aps":{"badge":3,"sound":"ping.aiff","alert":"\uD83D\uDCE7 \u2709 You have a new message"}}

You should only create one `Connection` per-process for each certificate/key pair you have. You do not need to create a new `Connection` for each notification. If you are only sending notifications to one app then there is no need for more than one `Connection`, if throughput is a problem then look at the `maxConnections` property.

### Setting up the feedback service

Apple recommends checking the feedback service periodically for a list of devices for which there were failed delivery attempts.

Using the `Feedback` object it is possible to periodically query the server for the list. Many of the options are similar to that of `Connection`, including the authentication configuration. It is recomended that you share the same configuration object between Connection and Feedback instances to ensure they stay in sync.

Attach a listener to the `feedback` event to receive the output as two arguments, the `time` returned by the server (epoch time) and a `Buffer` object containing the device token - this event will be emitted for each device separately. Alternatively you can enable the `batchFeedback` option and the `feedback` event will provide an array of objects containing `time` and `device` properties.

	var options = {
		"batchFeedback": true,
		"interval": 300
	};

	var feedback = new apn.Feedback(options);
	feedback.on("feedback", function(devices) {
		devices.forEach(function(item) {
			// Do something with item.device and item.time;
		});
	});

By specifying a time interval (in seconds) `Feedback` will periodically query the service without further intervention.

More information about the feedback service can be found in the [feedback service documentation][fs].

## Debugging

If you experience difficulties sending notifications or using the feedback service you can enable debug messages within the library by running your application with `DEBUG=apn` or `DEBUG=apnfb` set as an environment variable.

You are encouraged to read the extremely informative [Troubleshooting Push Notifications][tn2265] Tech Note in the first instance, in case your query is answered there.

## Support

If you have any questions or difficulties working with the module, the [node-apn Google group][googlegroup] should be your first port of call. 

Please include as much detail as possible - especially debug logs, if the problem is reproducible sample code is also extremely helpful. GitHub Issues should only be created for verified problems and enhancements, this will allow them to be tracked more easily.
